# üè¶ Bankruptcy Prediction in Poland

This project is part of the **Applied Data Science Lab** by WorldQuant University and demonstrates an **end-to-end machine learning pipeline** for predicting company bankruptcy using real financial data collected by Polish economists. The focus is on building accurate models while handling **imbalanced classification problems**‚Äîa common challenge in real-world financial datasets.

## üìå Project Workflow

### 1. **Prepare Data**

* Navigated the file system via Linux terminal
* Loaded and cleaned the dataset using `pandas`
* Conducted EDA and explored class imbalance
* Applied **resampling techniques** (e.g. Over sampling ) to balance classes 

### 2. **Build Model**

* Trained two ensemble models:
‚úÖ **Random Forest Classifier**
An ensemble of decision parallel trees that votes on the final prediction to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

‚úÖ **Gradient Boosting Classifier**
A sequential model that builds trees to correct previous errors, optimizing performance through gradient descent.
* Tuned hyperparameters using `GridSearchCV` (14-minute grid search)
* Saved the best-performing model using best

### 3. **Communicate Results**

* Evaluated model using **precision, recall**, and **confusion matrix**
* Visualized **feature importance** and **confusion matrice**
* Created a custom Python module for real-world bankruptcy predictions

## üìä Data Source

The dataset contains financial ratios and metrics for Polish companies, labeled with whether they went bankrupt. The data was curated by a team of economists to support bankruptcy risk research. See the Metadata inside the dataset for more informations, data/Data Dictionary.ipynb for feature infos

## ‚úÖ How to Run

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Houssam-123-ship-it/Predicting-Bankruptcy-In-Poland-End-to-End-Machine-Learning-Project-
   cd Predicting-Bankruptcy-In-Poland-End-to-End-Machine-Learning-Project-
   ```

2. Install dependencies (see above)


3. Use `my_predictor_lesson.py` or `my_predictor_assignment.py` to test your own data or integrate into a larger project.

## üèÅ Final Thoughts

This project was an invaluable opportunity to apply advanced machine learning to a **high-impact financial domain**. It strengthened my understanding of **imbalanced data challenges**, **ensemble learning**, and how to **build and deploy models** that can be reused and shared across projects.

It‚Äôs more than just a predictive model‚Äîit's a hands-on tool you can extend to evaluate real-world bankruptcy risk scenarios.
